Ami Helper (better name being workshopped) is planned to be an app for
amigurumi enthusiasts.

I want to make an easy and intuitive tool that anyone can start
inputting stitches in and, in real time, see a rough idea of what the result
would be.

TODO
*When clicking on stitch in tabulation, bring camera to stitch in virtual space
and highlight stitch.

*Add visual representation of control button toggling

*Add x, y, and z axis to renderer

*Add button for resetting camera

*Add toggle for stationary camera or one that follows current stitch

*For completed stitchs, create visual representation of different stitches (e.g. single, double)

*Add effect to control buttons when pressed

*Add effect to tracker when completing stitches

*Add effect to the 3D stitch in renderer when completing stitches

*Add logins

*Add utility to save/export tabulations as text documents

*Add functionality in controls to choose variants (e.g. drag 'Stitch' to change it to half double crochet or double crochet)

*Bisect tabulation.  One right side should just be the total

*Decide what and why goes into Meny and Profile

*Work on the actual 3D rendering, haha
